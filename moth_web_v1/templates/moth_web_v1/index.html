    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <p>
      Here is what you need to do:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="register.html">Register</a> your team.
        This only needs to happen once per team,
        so if somebody else on your team has already done it,
        you don't need to.
      </li>

      <li>
        Get an <a href="puzzles.html">overview of puzzles</a>,
        and start working on something.
        The list of open puzzles changes over time,
        you need to reload the page to get the current version!
      </li>

      <li>
        Check the <a href="scoreboard.html">scoreboard</a>
        in another tab,
        to see how your team is doing.
      </li>
    </ol>
